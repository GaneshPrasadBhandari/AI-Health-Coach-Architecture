## 📘 Overview
This project presents a complete **Enterprise AI Supply Chain Architecture** — a real-world operational framework that transforms traditional supply chains into **intelligent, adaptive, and autonomous systems** using AI, MLOps, and governance.  

Unlike proofs-of-concept that often fail in deployment, this architecture is built for:  
✅ **End-to-end automation** | ✅ **Real-time decision-making** | ✅ **Scalable multi-cloud deployment** | ✅ **Continuous learning**

## ⚙️ Problem Statement
Modern global supply chains face:
- **Forecasting errors** leading to excess inventory or stockouts.  
- **Siloed systems** across procurement, logistics, and production.  
- **Manual decisions** that slow down operations and reduce agility.  
- **Lack of explainability** and governance in AI decision-making.

## 🚀 Solution: The "Decision Intelligence" Core
The **Enterprise AI Supply Chain Architecture** introduces:
- **AI Decision Intelligence Core** — A hybrid of predictive and prescriptive AI that continuously forecasts, optimizes, and acts.  
- **MLOps + Governance Stack** — Ensures continuous deployment, monitoring, and ethical AI operations.  
- **Human-in-the-loop Feedback Loop** — Balances high-velocity automation with human accountability.

## 🔹 Layered Technical Deep-Dive
1. **Data Ingestion Layer**
   - Real-time data from IoT sensors, ERP systems (SAP/Oracle), CRM, and logistics APIs streamed via **Kafka / AWS Kinesis**.  
2. **AI Core (Decision Intelligence Engine)**
   - **Forecasting:** Demand prediction using LSTM / Transformer-based architectures.  
   - **Optimization:** Reinforcement learning + heuristics to minimize cost and delivery time.  
3. **MLOps & Governance Layer**
   - Continuous deployment pipelines using **MLflow or Kubeflow**.  
   - Bias detection, model drift monitoring, and explainable AI (XAI) dashboards.  
4. **Execution & Feedback Loop**
   - Closed-loop system: Real-world outcomes → Model retraining → Decision refinement.
